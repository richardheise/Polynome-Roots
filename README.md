# Polynomial Root Finding Methods

This project implements three different methods for finding the roots of a polynomial: Bisection, Newton-Raphson, and Secant.

## Code Organization

The code is organized into the following directories:

- `src/`: Contains the source code (`.c` and `.h` files).
- `bin/`: Contains the compiled executable.
- `obj/`: Contains the object files (`.o` files).

## How to Run

To compile and run the code, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```
2. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./bin/labZero
   ```

## Cleaning Up

To remove the compiled files, you can use the following command:

```bash
make clean
```
